The goal of this project was to find the Kevin Bacon of the NBA, or to find the players that have played with the greatest number of unique players in their basketball careers. bfscrape.py scrapes information about seasons/teams played for from basketball-reference.com and outputs comma separated values that can be placed into an excel file. This excel file was then transformed into a large SQL query through sqilizer.io and uploaded to a mySQL database and also imported into an R module. The R code outputs a text file containing an adjacency matrix, which then can be used in creating a graph with the NetworkX library in the subsequent python scripts.
